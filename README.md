A take home project for Fetch. 

### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features



### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

    I prioritized modularity, testability, clean code, and modern best practices in architecture and design patterns. I chose to focus on these areas as despite the project's simplicity these are the touches that give a codebase a professional polish. 

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

    This project took approximately 3.5 hours.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

    Within the Recipe feature set I chose to swap simplicity for testability in the networking module. I made extensive use of protocol oriented programming here to allow for end to end testing of alternate data scenarios as well as mocking of http responses for unit testing. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

    Given more time i'd have come up with a more custom animation for the list to detail presentation than the simple slide animation used in the project. 

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

I apologize for the lateness in turning this project in, I along with my family were displaced by wildfire evacuations this past week. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback please reach out to me at codymorleyinc@gmail.com . Thank you so much for the opportunity, I truly have a passion for iOS and Apple platforms and hope that I can bring that passion to Fetch.
